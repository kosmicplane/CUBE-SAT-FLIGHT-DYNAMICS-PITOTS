# Modelo-Matematico
Atipan√° is an atmospheric nanosatellite designed to sample wind currents and measure air properties (pressure, humidity, temperature) at various altitudes within a range of 500 meters. Developed by students from Universidad de Antioquia and Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, this project aims to understand the dynamics of air currents, validate the system design, and potentially expand the mission to characterize air quality and explore wind energy applications.
